This gives them the nice property of replicating just like any other data stored in CouchDB. They are also simple to write as they can use the built-in jQuery libraries and plugins that ship with CouchDB.\n\n[More info about CouchApps here.](http://couchapp.org)\n\n## Deploying this app\n\nAssuming you just cloned this app from git, and you have changed into the app directory in your terminal, you want to push it to your CouchDB with the CouchApp command line tool, like this:\n\n    couchapp push . http://name:password@hostname:5984/mydatabase\n\nIf you don't have a password on your CouchDB (admin party) you can do it like this (but it's a bad, idea, set a password):\n\n    couchapp push . http://hostname:5984/mydatabase\n\nIf you get sick of typing the URL, you should setup a `.couchapprc` file in the root of your directory. Remember not to check this into version control as it will have passwords in it.\n\nThe `.couchapprc` file should have contents like this:\n\n    {\n      \"env\" : {\n        \"public\" : {\n          \"db\" : \"http://name:pass@mycouch.couchone.com/mydatabase\"\n        },\n        \"default\" : {\n          \"db\" : \"http://name:pass@localhost:5984/mydatabase\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n\nNow that you have the `.couchapprc` file set up, you can push your app to the CouchDB as simply as:\n\n    couchapp push\n\nThis pushes to the `default` as specified. To push to the `public` you'd run:\n\n    couchapp push public\n\nOf course you can continue to add more deployment targets as you see fit, and give them whatever names you like.", "_id": "_design/accounts", "shows": {}}
